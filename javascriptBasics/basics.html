            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server); it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>: Javascript variables are containers for storing data values. Imagine a cup filled with coffee -- the variable is the cup, the data is the coffee. All JavaScript variables must have unique names (called "identifiers").</li>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>: Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables -- coffee is poured into the cup, and now it holds a content (a value). The "=" operator is used to make these assignments.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Data Types</a>: Data types are an important concept; you cannot operate on a variable if you don't know its data type. JavaScript has six primitive data types: Boolean (<span>true</span> or <span>false</span>), <span>Null</span> i.e. nothing, Number (<span>42</span>, <span>3.14159</span>), String ("hello world"), Array (<span>[1,2,3,4]</span>), and Object (<span>{first: "Jane", last: "Doe"}</span>).</li>
                <li><a href="#">Conditonals</a>: Conditionals designate a block of code to be executed <span>if</span> (and, unless the block occurs or is referenced elsewhere, only if) a certain condition is met. Supplemental conditionals like <span>else if</span> and <span>else</span> then inform the program what to do when the condition is not met.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a>: There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action a given number of times or until a certain condition is met.</li>
                <li><a href="#">Functions</a>: functions are like variables associated not with more or less simple values but blocks of code. When the function is "called," the block of code is executed. Functions allow developers to write code that is both precise and clear: storing code keeps us from repeating ourselves, and labeling it helps other people to understand what the code does.</li>
